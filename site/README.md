# Climb and Area Codes

This is a **draft** of a simple id scheme for rock climbs.

It's static HTML. You can view it
[here](https://stele-climbing.gitlab.io/climb-and-area-codes/)
and submit issues and patches on
[gitlab](https://gitlab.com/stele-climbing/climb-and-area-codes)
(or [github](https://github.com/stele-climbing/climb-and-area-codes)).
Any local server should be fine for development.

```sh
$ (cd site; python3 -m http.server 8000)
$ open http://localhost:8000
```
